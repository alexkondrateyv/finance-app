## README

I do the web application that implement a solution to display price tickers data on the UI in realtime.

Requirements:
- application should connect to the locally running service
- application should render price changes for some tickers in real time

As a bonus I implemented:
- A dynamic line graph that shows the last 5 updates (more are possible). This allows you to track price trends.

Technologies:
- React (with hooks)
- Redux 
- Socket.io 
- Recharts

## Example JSON Response from the Price Ticker service
